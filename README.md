# Keyboard Plus

## Description 

K-plus is tool for enabling layers on non-mechanical keyboards that don't usually have access to alternate layouts. K-plus is built on [AutoHotKey Script v2](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/AutoHotkey.htm) and is therefore primarily a Windows tool. 

It's designed to be configurable and flexible; supporting as many layers as you'd like to include. Once configured, a compiled version can easily be carried on a flash drive and run on any Windows device, letting you move your layers between devices.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork/create a pull request to fix bugs, refactor code, or add new featues. While I aimed to create something flexible and easy to configure, I'm certainly not a master of AHK and there's certainly room for improvement.

## Credits

The AHK software and docs have been invaluable to making K-Plus work.

In addition, [DreymaR's Extend layer](https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL) layout has been used as one of the suggested default layers, and I highly reccomend checking out the Extend layers in general if you aren't already familiar.

## Additional Resources

K-plus is a useful tool, but it was designed to serve a single individual's needs. DreymaR's Extend layer is a modifier-based program with a great deal more versatility than k-plus. Although it lacks layer toggling (its one major flaw) it does come with a GUI, support for a variety of keyboard layouts, an active community with active developers, and many more features (like powerstrings, chords, and more advanced dead keys) than I could create. I reccomend checking it out for more details. 

I also have to reccomend [kmonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad), an incredibly flexible layer program designed to work (to one degree or another) on Linux, Windows, and Mac. While the tool is less actively developed, it includes a wider variety of features including layer toggling, dead keys, chords, powerstrings, modifier-based layers, and variable key functions depending on how the key is pressed (double-tapped, held vs tapped, etc.). While support seems to be primarily focused on Linux systems, kmonad truly offers it all, though it comes with a comparable amount of configuration to set up even simple layers. Definately give it a whirl if you lean more towards 'poweruser'.
